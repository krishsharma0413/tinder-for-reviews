You can also use for feedback and postinformation tables yourself to add the data you like and configure the database.
```sql
INSERT INTO feedback (id, review_content, positive, negative, neutral, polarity) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

INSERT INTO postinformation (id, creation, link, source) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```
and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

- right swipes or green button = positive.
- left swipe or red button = negative
- white button "neu" = neutral

`Usecase: You can use this to label your dataset for sentiment analysis, feedback analysis, etc in a fun way.`
